## The scenario

Picking a house and determining its sale value is affected by many factors such as previous house prices, its location, the condition of the house, etc. You can use these factors to form a pattern in determining the value of a particular house.

A machine learning model works the same way. By using the data like the ones mentioned above, we can make predictions on the value of a particular house.

## The Model

In this lesson we started the model with what we call a **Decision tree**.

A Decision tree is just like the data structure tree that we know.

The set of capturing or forming patterns from data is called fitting or training the model. The data that is used to train the model is called training data (very original huh).
